# Pokedex app with React + Typescript

I created this simple app to practice my react + typescript skills. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## UI
I used the [Pokedex app design by Junior Saraiva on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1202971127473077147).

## API
I used the [pokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Images
For the images I used the ones from [pokeApi sprites](https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites)
